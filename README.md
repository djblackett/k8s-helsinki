# Devops with Kubernetes
## University of Helsinki

These are my completed exercises for the University of Helsinki's Devops with Kubernetes course

I tried to keep the code organized such that the all the code in the directories matches up to the exercise number of its name. This resulted in a lot of duplicated code, but it also makes the course progress readily apparent.
